          Color spots against a light gray or muted field highlight and

          There is nothing as mysterious as a fact clearly described.

        <blockquote>
          At the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question: Compared

        <blockquote>
          Constancy of design puts the emphasis on changes in data, not changes

          The deepest reason for displays that portray complexity and intricacy
